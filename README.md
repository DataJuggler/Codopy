# Codopy
This site will soon be live at https://codopy.com (not live yet).

Codopy was created so I can copy code from Visual Studio and paste it in a Git Hub read me file and have the formatting be correct.

Codopy was also built because DataJuggler.Blazor.Components reached 40,000 Nuget installs today (not sure how much 40,000 times zero is in dollars).

Nuget: DataJuggler.Blazor.Components

Here is a video of how the site was built:
